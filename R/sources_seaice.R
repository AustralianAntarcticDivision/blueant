#' Sea ice data sources
#'
#' Data sources providing (primarily satellite-derived) sea ice data:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item "Sea Ice Concentrations from Nimbus-7 SMMR and DMSP SSM/I-SSMIS Passive Microwave Data, Version 2". Passive microwave estimates of sea ice concentration at 25km spatial resolution. Daily and monthly resolution, available from 1-Oct-1978 to near-present. Data undergo a quality checking process and are updated annually. Available only in netcdf format. Accepts \code{hemisphere} values of "south", "north", "both". More recent data are available via the 'Near-Real-Time DMSP SSMIS Daily Polar Gridded Sea Ice Concentrations, Version 2' source
#'   \item "Near-Real-Time DMSP SSMIS Daily Polar Gridded Sea Ice Concentrations, Version 2". Near-real-time passive microwave estimates of sea ice concentration at 25km, daily resolution. Available only in netcdf format. Accepts \code{hemisphere} values of "south", "north", "both". Accepts \code{time_resolution} values of "day" or "month". Accepts \code{years} parameter as a vector of years.
#'   \item "NSIDC passive microwave supporting files": Grids and other support files for NSIDC passive microwave sea ice data
#'   \item "Nimbus Ice Edge Points from Nimbus Visible Imagery": This data set (NmIcEdg2) estimates the location of the North and South Pole sea ice edges at various times during the mid to late 1960s, based on recovered Nimbus 1 (1964), Nimbus 2 (1966), and Nimbus 3 (1969) visible imagery
#'   \item "Artist AMSR-E sea ice concentration": Passive microwave estimates of daily sea ice concentration at 6.25km spatial resolution, from 19-Jun-2002 to 2-Oct-2011. Previously accepted formats "geotiff" and/or "hdf", but these are now ignored (the only file format available now is netcdf)
#'   \item "Artist AMSR2 near-real-time sea ice concentration": Near-real-time passive microwave estimates of daily sea ice concentration at 6.25km spatial resolution, from 24-July-2012 to present
#'   \item "Artist AMSR2 near-real-time 3.125km sea ice concentration": Near-real-time passive microwave estimates of daily sea ice concentration at 3.125km spatial resolution, from 24-July-2012 to present
#'   \item "Artist AMSR2 supporting files": Grids and landmasks for Artist AMSR2 passive microwave sea ice data
#'   \item "CERSAT SSM/I sea ice concentration": Passive microwave sea ice concentration data at 12.5km resolution, 3-Dec-1991 to present
#'   \item "CERSAT SSM/I sea ice concentration supporting files": Grids for the CERSAT SSM/I sea ice concentration data
#'   \item "Sea ice lead climatologies": Long-term relative sea ice lead frequencies for the Arctic (November - April 2002/03 - 2018/19) and Antarctic (April - September 2003 - 2019) derived from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery
#'   \item "MODIS Composite Based Maps of East Antarctic Fast Ice Coverage": Maps of East Antarctic landfast sea-ice extent, generated from approx. 250,000 1 km visible/thermal infrared cloud-free MODIS composite imagery (augmented with AMSR-E 6.25-km sea-ice concentration composite imagery when required). Coverage from 2000-03-01 to 2008-12-31
#'   \item "Circum-Antarctic landfast sea ice extent": maps of Antarctic landfast sea ice, derived from NASA MODIS imagery. There are 24 maps per year, spanning the 18 year period from March 2000 to Feb 2018
#'   \item "National Ice Center Antarctic daily sea ice charts": The USNIC Daily Ice Edge product depicts the daily sea ice pack in red (8-10/10ths or greater of sea ice), and the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) in yellow. The marginal ice zone is the transition between the open ocean (ice free) and pack ice. The MIZ is very dynamic and affects the air-ocean heat transport, as well as being a significant factor in navigational safety. The daily ice edge is analyzed by sea ice experts using multiple sources of near real time satellite data, derived satellite products, buoy data, weather, and analyst interpretation of current sea ice conditions. The product is a current depiction of the location of the ice edge vice a satellite derived ice edge product. Accepts a \code{formats} parameter which can be one of "filled" or "vector". Accepts a \code{years} parameter to restrict the data to certain years
#'   \item "Polarview Sentinel-1 imagery": Sentinel-1 imagery from polarview.aq. Accepts an \code{acquisition_date} parameter (default is the last four days including today), a \code{formats} parameter (one or both of "jpg", "geotiff", default is both), and a \code{polygon} parameter, which is a polygon within which to search - either a WKT polygon string in EPSG:3031 projection, or an object of class \code{sfc_POLYGON}, which will be converted to a WKT string internally

Ice surface temperature data (MYD/MOD29 col. 6) from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer are used to derive daily observations of sea ice leads in both polar regions. Sea ice leads are defined as significant local surface temperature anomalies and they are automatically identified during a two-stage process, including 1) the tile-based retrieval of potential sea ice leads and 2) the identification of cloud artefacts using fuzzy logic (see Reiser et al., 2020 for further details). Subsequently, all daily sea ice lead maps are combined to long-term averages showing the climatological distribution of leads in the Arctic and Antarctic. The dataset represents an update for the Arctic (Willmes & Heinemann, 2016) and is the first for the Antarctic. These maps reveal that multiple distinct features with increased lead frequencies are present that are related to bathymetric structures, e.g. the continental shelf break or ridges and troughs.",
